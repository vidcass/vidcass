Hi, I’m @vidcass

I’m interested in OSINT and data visulations and just making complicated things easier to digest. 

I like spending hours learning about how to make a task that normally takes 20 minutes, only take 1, and then never do that task again. Relevent XKCD: https://xkcd.com/1319/

I’m currently learning python, chess, and... just how to get by... generally.
